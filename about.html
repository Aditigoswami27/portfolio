   <!--About -->
   <div class="about-section">
    <div class="website-text"><p>Hello, I am Aditi Goswami from Bhilai, Chhattisgarh, India. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's 
      degree in Information Technology at Shri Shankaracharya Technical Campus, Bhilai. I have consistently 
      performed well academically over the past five years.</p>
      
      <p>I am passionate about programming and have gained proficiency in Python, C, C++,
         Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). I have also completed
          a Full Stack Development course on Udemy, where I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, 
          React.js, Express.js, Bootstrap, Git, GitHub, Web3, APIs, SQL, and PostgreSQL. 
          Through various projects, I have applied these skills practically.</p>
      
      <p>In addition to my technical abilities, I enjoy public speaking, debates, and modeling,
         which have helped me develop strong communication and presentation skills. These experiences 
         have prepared me to work well in team settings and explain complex ideas clearly.</p>
      
      <p>My life has had its challenges, such as supporting my mother through her battle with cancer 
      and dealing with my father’s unemployment. These experiences have made me resilient, independent,
       and responsible.</p>
      
      <p>I aspire to become a software developer at Google. I am committed to achieving this goal 
        and am eager to bring my skills, dedication, and passion for technology to a dynamic team.
